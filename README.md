With our Amazon Alexa Skill “Angekreuzt" 
we seek to build an educational tool allowing users to collect valuable information on German politics. 
On September 24th 2017, Germans went to the polls to elect their new Bundestag. 
It is on this day when most Germans made use of their fundamental right to participate directly in setting the country's direction for the next four years. 
In a general election, informed choices are critical. 
To bear the responsibility of voting one must have reasons to vote for a specific candidate or party. 
Our Alexa Skill “Angekreuzt" informs users on candidates’ and parties’ standpoints to all significant political topics: 
from labor to integration over foreign affairs and education, simply ask “Angekreuzt” about a party’s goals for the next four years and beyond. 
A highlight of angekreuzt is that you can ask your every single elected member of the Bundestag on their opinion and goals on all major topics. 
With this Amazon Alexa Skill, we wish to provide an easy way for users to ask their local and national politicians on any matter they deem significant. 
The Skill is educational and could be applied in schools and universities. 
And finally: the German voting system isn’t easy, many Germans do not understand it themselves. 
Simply ask “Angekreuzt" for a quick and simple explanation of the general election in Germany.
